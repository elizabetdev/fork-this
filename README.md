"Fork This" tells the story of a designer who codes - me, Miuki Miu.

When I started coding, I used to think my code was never good enough.
Now, I believe that doing is what matters.

“Fork This” aims to encourage women to follow their passion.
Overcoming imposter syndrome is a struggle, but if you just keep going, you can achieve anything you want. You can DESIGN, CODE, DESIGN and CODE, or more!

You can find the project on:

Aaaaaand... If you’re into music and want to give it a try:

- Write your lyrics

Just fork the project and submit your versioooooonn!!!! You can find different versions of the song [here](/music).

Have fun,
**Miuki Miu** - \*the DESIGNER who CODES.

## Lyric

Are you devs ready?\
I’m a designer who codes!\
They call me Miuki\
Are you ready?

I’ve been designing with Sketch\
Calling all these APIs, Fetch\
Server-side rendering Next\
You can call me explorer, Edge

Struggling with life cycles, React\
You can call me lightweight, Preact\
I’m way too complicated, Typescript\
But I’m still in this class, type this

Learning from mistakes Microsoft\
More than a million skills, Lara croft\
Trying to not look back, Angular\
I don’t have an expression, Regular

Animating SVGs, Original\
Let me kill it one time, terminal\
Watch me giving a talk, Netflix\
I’m gonna keep it simple, ES6

**I’m coding like a criminal\
Designing like a miracle\
They say I’m Invisible\
Fork this, I’m original**

Yeah, open source queen\
Old school girl, coding with VIM\
Github stars, github queen\
Feeling it, feeling it, changing the scene

I’m an old school girl, hi5\
Sonic and Tails, Megadrive\
Coding and rhymes, Spotify\
You devs can’t see me, wi-fi

No competition, goodbye\
No one can reach me, all right\
Another level, that’s right\
Call me Eleven, Sci-fi

**I’m coding like a criminal\
Designing like a miracle\
They say I’m Invisible\
Fork this, I’m original**
